# ScorOS

ScorOS is an Operating System created in GBStudio. My goal is to push the limits of simplicity, and make something amazing out of it.

My project ScorOS is currently only being developed by myself. So any big updates will not happen too often. I do update the emulated version in very small increments, so every update in the emulated version will typically not be a big one, unless stated otherwise, or If I decide to release a big design or function update.

I hope that when this project bursts into life that you can all enjoy using it, just as much as I enjoy creating it.

# ScorOS Information

ScorOS is a tool constantly in development; Do not expect early versions to be very impressive or worth your time. Any updates I make I will erase the previous version.
My goal is to allow the most recent version to be available rather than older, outdated, and less powerful versions, If you don't like an update you can request on the new update
for something to be changed.
