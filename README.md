# ScorOS
ScorOS is a fantasy computer that I'm building in many different platforms and types of code. My goal is to push the limits of simplicity, and make something amazing out of it.

My project ScorOS is currently only being developed by myself. So any big updates will not happen too often. I do update the emulated version in very small increments, so every update in the emulated version will typically not be a big one, unless stated otherwise, or If I decide to release a big design or function update.

There are multiple versions I'm building:
- Emulated Version (Built in GB Studio)
- Windows Application (Built In C# and Lua or JS or with the use of Visual Studio Community)
- And possibly more.

I hope that when this project bursts into life that you can all enjoy using it, just as much as I enjoy creating it.
